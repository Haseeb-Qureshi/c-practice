# Notes (Part 4)

## Mutexes & Lock Guards

## Producer-consumer queue
* Some worker is enqueuing work for another thread to perform
* Multiple threads may produce work, but want only one thread to serially perform that work
* If consumer wants the next unit of work, they should pull next job off the queueâ€”if there are no elements in the queue, they should sleep until there is something in the queue
